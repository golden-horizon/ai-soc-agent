# Agentic AI Security Operations Platform

An Agentic AI-powered Security Operations Platform that combines multi-agent investigation workflows, threat intelligence enrichment, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, case management, and real-time security monitoring into a unified security operations environment.

The platform demonstrates how modern security teams can leverage Agentic AI architectures, MCP integrations, Pydantic AI, FastAPI services, and React dashboards to automate and accelerate security investigations.

## Key Features

### Agentic AI Investigation Workflow

Security incidents are processed through a coordinated multi-agent pipeline:

* Log Collection Agent
* Detection Agent
* MITRE ATT&CK Agent
* Threat Intelligence Agent
* Correlation Agent
* Severity Escalation Agent
* Case Management Agent
* Investigation Agent

Each agent contributes specialized context before passing results to the next stage, producing a complete investigation output.

## Security Capabilities

### Threat Detection

* SQL Injection Detection
* Brute Force Detection
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Detection
* API Abuse Detection
* Session Hijacking Detection
* Correlated Multi-Vector Attacks

### Threat Intelligence Enrichment

* IP Reputation Analysis
* Geographic Attribution
* Threat Scoring
* Risk Prioritization
* Security Context Enrichment

### MITRE ATT&CK Integration

The platform maps detected activity to MITRE ATT&CK techniques and tactics, enabling analysts to understand attacker behavior and investigation priorities.

Example mappings:

| Attack Type   | MITRE Technique                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| SQL Injection | T1190 – Exploit Public-Facing Application |
| Brute Force   | T1110 – Brute Force                       |
| XSS           | T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter |

## AI Technologies

### Pydantic AI

The platform uses Pydantic AI for:

* Structured investigation outputs
* Agent communication
* Validation of security intelligence
* Consistent investigation reports

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The platform demonstrates MCP-based integrations for:

* Security investigation tools
* Threat intelligence enrichment
* Incident analysis workflows
* Agent-tool communication

### Local LLM Ready Architecture

The platform is designed for integration with local Large Language Models such as:

* Ollama
* Qwen
* Future on-premise security LLM deployments

The architecture allows AI-generated investigation summaries and analyst recommendations without requiring cloud-hosted AI services.
