# Agentic AI Security Operations Platform

An Agentic AI-powered Security Operations Platform that automates security investigations through a coordinated multi-agent workflow. The platform combines threat detection, threat intelligence enrichment, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, case management, FastAPI services, and a React dashboard to help analysts investigate and prioritize security incidents.

The project demonstrates practical implementation of Agentic AI architectures, Model Context Protocol (MCP), Pydantic AI, multi-agent systems, and security automation within a modern Security Operations Center (SOC) environment.

## Key Features

### Agentic AI Investigation Workflow

Security incidents are processed through a coordinated multi-agent pipeline where each agent performs a specialized security function before passing context to the next stage.

Agents include:

* Log Collection Agent
* Detection Agent
* MITRE ATT&CK Agent
* Threat Intelligence Agent
* Correlation Agent
* Severity Escalation Agent
* Case Management Agent
* Investigation Agent

The workflow produces structured investigation outputs containing threat intelligence enrichment, MITRE ATT&CK mappings, escalation decisions, and analyst recommendations.

### Threat Intelligence Enrichment

* IP Reputation Analysis
* Geographic Attribution
* Threat Scoring
* Risk Prioritization
* Security Context Enrichment

### MITRE ATT&CK Integration

The platform maps security events to MITRE ATT&CK techniques and tactics, helping analysts understand attacker behavior and investigation priorities.

| Attack Type   | MITRE ATT&CK Technique                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| SQL Injection | T1190 – Exploit Public-Facing Application |
| Brute Force   | T1110 – Brute Force                       |
| XSS           | T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter |

### Case Management

* Case Creation
* Case Search
* Analyst Notes
* Investigation Updates
* Escalation Decisions
* Severity Tracking
* Investigation History

### Security Monitoring Dashboard

* Security Overview Metrics
* Incident Tracking
* AI Escalated Cases
* Threat Intelligence Panel
* MITRE ATT&CK Context
* Executive Dashboard
* Threat Hunting Workspace
* Interactive Investigation Portal

## AI Technologies

### Agentic AI

The platform uses a coordinated multi-agent architecture where specialized agents collaborate to investigate security incidents and generate investigation outcomes.

### Pydantic AI

Used for:

* Structured investigation outputs
* Data validation
* Agent communication
* Investigation reporting
* Workflow orchestration

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Used for:

* Security investigation tools
* Threat intelligence enrichment
* Incident analysis workflows
* Agent-to-tool communication
